This README is written by William Davies. I did not create this dataset but I have tried to retroactively understand it
and have made some additions.

* P21 R5 there is missing BVP and Respiration data. In `0802111708P21_inf.csv` the
frames with missing BVP and Respiration have all been set to 0. In the original `.xlsx` the frames
  were not set to 0.
